## Problem Set 1

The aim of this problem set was to introduce us to the various tools used in the course and to implement a function specification in Java. Below is a description of the Java class I implemented for this problem set. 

* Quadratic.java:
	* A function which returns a set of all the integer roots of a given polynomial. This function was required to pass all tests in QuadraticTest.java as well as some hidden tests implemented by the course staff.
